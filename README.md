**AdventureWorks ETL Pipeline**

This repository contains scripts and instructions for setting up an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the AdventureWorks database. Below are the steps to set up the pipeline:

***Prerequisites***
Ensure you have downloaded the AdventureWorks database backup from here and saved the .bak file to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\Backup. Make sure Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is installed on your system.

***Restoring the AdventureWorks Database***
To restore the AdventureWorks database:

1. Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance (e.g., MSSQL16.SQLEXPRESS).
3. Right-click on Databases in Object Explorer, select Restore Database....
4. Choose Device, click on the ellipsis (...), navigate to the .bak file location, select it, and click OK.
5. Verify the destination database name (e.g., AdventureWorks) and click OK to begin the restore process.
Once complete, you should see AdventureWorks listed under Databases in SSMS.

**ETL Pipeline Scripts**
This repository includes the following scripts for your ETL pipeline:

1. Extract : SQL script to extract data from AdventureWorks tables.
2. Transform : Python script for data transformations.
3. Load : SQL script to load transformed data into a target database or data warehouse.

***Additional Notes***
Customize the scripts based on your specific ETL requirements and ensure proper permissions and connectivity to your SQL Server instance for executing the scripts. Adjust file paths, database names, and table names as needed for your environment.
